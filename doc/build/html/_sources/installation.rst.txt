============

    *Tested on Ubuntu 20.04, Linux-5.8.0*


It is strongly advised to install the package in a new virtual environment using python 3.9::

    pyenv install 3.9.16 OCDenv
    pyenv activate OCDenv

Then from the root of the OCD_modeling source repository (where the `setup.py` is located), type::

    pip install -e .
