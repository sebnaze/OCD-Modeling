Restoration analysis
====================

The restoration analysis uses a combinatorial approach to permute all possible sets of up to six parameters at a time. 
Such combination of permuted parameters is called a **virtual intervention**. 
Default parameters are sampled from the OCD posteriors. Permuted parameters are sampled from the controls' posteriors. 
1000 simulations are run in parallel, each with a new draw from posterior distributions, for each virtual intervention.
 
Then, simulations are grouped by sets of 50 to get 20 independent cohorts for each virtual intervention.
The distance between the the virtual intervention and the reference healthy controls' simulations is evaluated 
as the sum of Wasserstein distances across pathways in frontostriatal functional connectivity space.


.. note::
    Subscript notation may differ from the publication, original code uses numbered subscripts rather than letters.
    The mapping is :
    
    | 1: O --> orbito-frontal cortex (OFC)
    | 2: L --> lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)
    | 3: N --> nucleus accumbens (NAcc)
    | 4: P --> dorsal putamen (dPut)

    :math:`\theta_{ij}` refers to parameter :math:`\theta` to population :math:`i` from population :math:`j`. 

Combinatorial permutations
--------------------------

We save the combinations of permuted parameters on the distributed filesystem such that all workers can access it.

.. code-block::

    params = ['C_12', 'C_13', 'C_24', 'C_31', 'C_34', 'C_42', 'eta_C_13', 'eta_C_24', 'sigma', 'sigma_C_13', 'sigma_C_24']
    combinations = []
    for i in range(0,6):
        for p in itertools.combinations(params, r=i+1):
            combinations.append(p)
    print("number of parameter combinations: "+str(len(combinations)))
    with open(os.path.join(proj_dir, 'postprocessing', 'params_combinations.pkl'), 'wb') as f:
        pickle.dump(combinations, f)

.. code-block::

    >>> number of parameter combinations: 1485

Then we generate new synthetic data using the adequate posteriors from either OCD or healthy controls. 
We run 1000 simulations (20 cohorts of 50 virtual subjects) for each vitual intervention.

Intervention improvement measure
--------------------------------


A Mann-Whitney U statistic was computed to quantify the functional improvement (as the distance to healthy controls FC) of the 
virtual intervention. A normalized measure (the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve -- AUC) of 
functional improvement is derived from the U statistic, and AUCs are sorted by number of intervention targets. 
This informs about how reliably parameters influence the restoration of healthy functional dynamics from OCD.

We plot the AUC of each virtual intervention (x-axis), showing the targeted parameters on the y-axis, 
according to their number of targets (colorcode):

  AUC measures for each virtual interventions (via `plot_distance_restore` function).


We also show the log-linear relationship between the efficacy of the five best intervention for each number of targets.

  :align: center

  Log-linear realtionship between virtual intervention AUC and number of intervention targets :math:`n_t`.


Parameters contribution measure
-------------------------------

To relate the contribution of changes in each parameter :math:`\theta` to the interventions' AUC value (using only statistically
significant AUC, i.e. :math:`p_{FWE}<0.05`) via a dot-product between the two variables.

  Contribution measures for each target colorcoded by number of targets.
