OCD modeling documentation
==========================

This project aims to model the changes of functional connectivity observed in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
compared to healthy subjects. 

We previously confirmed that OCD is associated with disrupted fronto-striatal connectivity using functional MRI 
at rest `(Naze et al., 2022)`_.

We also conducted a clinical trial to assess the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeted to the 
frontal pole to reduce OCD symptoms `(Cocchi et al., 2023)`_.

*The frontostriatal regions disrupted in OCD: nucleus accumbens (red), putamen (magenta), orbitofrontal cortex (blue), and lateral prefrontal cortex (green).* 


Here, we provide a model of frontostriatal dynamics derived from a well-known decision making model. 
Two of those models are coupled to simulate the ventral and dorsal frontostriatal circuits *in-silico*. 
Parameters are optimized to reproduce healthy and OCD functional connectivity using Bayesian inference. 
Virtual interventions targeting sets of model paramteters are performed to simulate the restoration of healthy functional dynamics from the OCD condition.
We generate predictions about best intervention targets, and test those predictions using longitudinal dataset of OCD subjects
showing improvement of symptoms over time.

  Schematic of the analysis steps and modelling framework.


This documentation exposes this modeling and analysis work along **four main axis**:

Dynamical system analysis
   Development and analysis of the dynamical system derived from the Reduced Wong-Wang model `(Deco et al., 2013)`_.
   This includes phaseplane and bifurcation analysis of the model dynamics in two-dimensions.

Simulation-based inference
   Large scale simulation framework performing the Bayesian optimization of model parameters to fit healthy and OCD 
   frontostriatal functional connectivity. This section also introduce how to leverage the outputs of the optimization
   to generate synthetic data. 

Restoration analysis
   Virtual intervention framework to assess which targeted changes in sets of parameters bring functional connectivity 
   closer to the healthy regime. This implies the definition of intervention efficacy and parameter contribution measures.

Digital twins validation
   Validation framework using the concept of digital twins: pairing OCD subjects from the empirical dataset to virtual subjects 
   from the simulated dataset. This pairing permits to associate the improvement of symptoms in the empirical data to the changes
   of parameters in the model, and test the predictions generated by the restoration analysis. 


The package is composed of **three major modules**:

Models
   Classes of dynamical systems derived from the Reduced Wong-Wang model of perception `(Wong & Wang, 2006)`_, 
   tailored to modeling OCD, with recording, scoring and plotting functions.


Analysis
   Analytical and numerical analysis of the two-populations model. 
   Phase portrait, bifurcation analysis, symbolic analysis and piece-wise linear approximations.


MCMC
   Framework for Bayesian optimizations using Approximate-Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte-Carlo 
   sampling (ABC-SMC) via the `pyABC <https://pyabc.readthedocs.io/>`_ package. Parameters optimizations are performed 
   to fit both patients and controls cohorts. Key parameters are extracted for optimized potential future treatment 
   through inference and analysis of the resulting dynamics.
